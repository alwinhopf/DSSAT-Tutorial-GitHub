Phenology

Time requirement to progress from one growth stage to next: “Photothermal time”, 1 calendar day = 1 photothermal day under optimal conditions, less under non-optimal conditions

Planting to Emergence, to First True Leaf, to end juvenile Phase, to Floral Induction, to Flowering, to First Pod, to First Seed, to Physiological Maturity  
Proportion of time between first seed formed and physiological maturity that last seed can be formed  
First flower to last leaf on stem (Rate of leaf appearance also determined by thermal time)

Each growth stage can have different requirement, can also be 0 if specific stage is not existent in physiology of plant

Additional effects on phenology:

-        Water and Nitrogen stress slow down reproductive growth but accelerate progress towards maturity à shorter yield formation phase, less yield. In General: faster development à shorter life cycle à but not necessarily more yield

-        Photoperiod effect, slow down when critical daylength not met

Senecense:

SENRTE to drive general leaf senescence, based on protein mined form leaves multiplied by factor to determine leaf weight senesced

SENRT2 to drive leaf senescence end of season (after flowering?), based on protein lost multiplied by factor to determine leaf weight senesced

! SENRT2    Factor by which leaf weight is multiplied to determine senescence each day after NR7 (g(leaf) g(protein loss))

! SENRTE    Factor by which protein mined from leaves each day is multiplied to determine LEAF senescence. (g(leaf) / g(protein loss))
