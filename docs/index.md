# Welcome to the DSSAT Tutorial


The intention of this tutorial is to provide a step-by-step guide for users with limited previous experience. The DSSAT software package contains a number of different groups of crop models. This tutorial is focused on the CROPGRO model within DSSAT, specifically setting up a simulation, adding, adapting or calibrating a new crop or experiment as well as some key functions and parameters of CROPGRO. Most descriptions will also apply to other models within DSSAT, but specifically the calibration and adaptation of new crops or datasets will be somewhat unique to CROPGRO. Other models might have different functions and capabilities that will require a different approach. 

General information about DSSAT can be found on the [DSSAT Website](https://dssat.net/)


## Learning Resources for DSSAT

[Where and How to Learn DSSAT](../src/site/notes/DSSAT-Tutorial-GitHub/docs/DSSAT%20Learning%20Resources/Where%20and%20How%20to%20Learn%20DSSAT.md)


## DSSAT Installation

General users with a windows system can install the regular version of DSSAT with a graphical user interface: [Installation of DSSAT GUI](DSSAT%20Setup/Installation%20of%20DSSAT%20GUI.md)

If you want to run DSSAT on a non-Windows system, via the command line, or read and edit the source code, you need to install the "Developer Version": [Installation of DSSAT Developer Version](DSSAT%20Setup/Installation%20of%20DSSAT%20Developer%20Version.md)



## Running a reference simulation in DSSAT

[Overview about a DSSAT Simulation](../src/site/notes/DSSAT-Tutorial-GitHub/docs/Creating%20and%20Running%20a%20DSSAT%20Simulation/Overview%20about%20a%20DSSAT%20Simulation.md)

Visualizing and analyzing simulation outputs in DSSAT

Visualizing outputs in R-Studio ('DSSAT' package)
