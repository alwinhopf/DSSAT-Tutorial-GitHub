-        PlantGro = height, width, biomass growth

-        SoilNi and SoilNiBal = soil nitrogen balance

For example: checking nitrogen number of applications and amounts. This should match what you have specified in experimental settings. Colors indicate different variables and treatments. Note that units are sometimes scaled, indicated by x 10 after variable name.

N uptake and leaching. As expected, higher N experiment has more uptake (since more N available), but uptake reaches plateau which could indicate excess nitrogen. Nitrogen leaching graph confirms higher leaching in higher nitrogen treatment.
